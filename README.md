# Data Science Internship Tasks 🧑‍💻

A collection of tasks and projects completed during my data science internship at Prodigy InfoTech, showcasing various technical skills, data analysis, and machine learning solutions.  


## Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier for Predicting Customer Purchases 🌳  
**Objective:** Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.  

**Key steps included:**  
- Dataset overview: Explored the bank marketing campaign dataset.  
- Preprocessing:  
  - Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`.  
  - Replaced 'unknown' values in some columns with 'other'.  
- Applied **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance.  
- Split data into training and testing sets.  
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV** to optimize the decision tree model.  
- Evaluated the model using accuracy score and classification report.  
- Implemented a prediction function for real-time customer purchase predictions.  

**Dataset:**
